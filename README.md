The following is the markdown syntax used to create the README file on
the [example GitHub
repository](https://github.com/alexanderresearch/Analytics). You can be
creative in terms of the format and content of the README file (e.g.,
add more sections and some figures), but it must include the following
elements at a minimum:

1.  A brief introduction of what this portfolio is about.
2.  A clickable URL link to the markdown CV you created in Assignment 1.
3.  A table of contents of assignments you have completed, with links to
    the Jupyter Notebooks of some assignments (at least 1).
